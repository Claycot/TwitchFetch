# TwitchFetch

UPDATE (10/3/16): It is with great sadness that I announce this program is no longer functioning. Twitch.tv. has migrated from its previous flash player to a satisfactory HTML5 player. The intention of this program was to avoid the poorly optimized flash player, which is no longer an issue. I may remake this program in the future. Until then, thanks for being part of TwitchFetch!

This VisualBasic program fetches livestream links from Twitch.tv, for usage in a media player such as MPC.
If selected, the program also opens the channel's chat in a browser window.

Demo shows older version. Version 1.2 now handles the 404 and outputs a message within the program!

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaauUjKHiMg

Usage:

1. Type the name of the Twitch.tv channel into the first text box. 
   Be sure to use the name given in the url bar (eg. Riot Games is riotgames).

2. Select a quality option. If you want to open chat, check the box.

3. Press the button.

4. Copy the outputted link into a video player and watch the stream!

Feel free to reuse my methods. I learned them from other kind people on the internet. 
  If you see something in my code that bothers you, please let me know so that I can fix it.

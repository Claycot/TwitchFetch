# TwitchFetch
This VisualBasic program fetches livestream links from Twitch.tv, for usage in a media player such as MPC.
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaauUjKHiMg

Usage:
1. Type the name of the Twitch.tv channel into the first text box. 
  Be sure to use the name given in the url bar (eg. Riot Games is riotgames).
2. Select a quality option.
3. Press the button.
4. Copy the outputted link into a video player and watch the stream!

Feel free to reuse my methods. I learned them from other kind people on the internet. 
  If you see something in my code that bothers you, please let me know so that I can fix it.
